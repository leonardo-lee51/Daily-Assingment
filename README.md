2.1 Function Review
    Exercise 1:
            Make a Function that takes in a vector of integers and returns the sum.
    Exercise 2:
            Make a function that takes in a vector and calculates and returns the average.
    Exercise 3:
            Make a function that calculates and returns the greates commun denominator given two numbers.

2.2 Function Overloading
    Exercise 1:
            Overload Exercise 1 from 2.1 to work with floats and doubles.
    Exercise 2:
            Overload Exercise 2 from 2.1 to work with floats and doubles.
    Exercise 3: 
            Overload Exercise 3 from 2.1 to work with 3 numbers.
    Challenge: 
            Overload exercise 3 to calculate the GCD of a vector of integers. Use the Euclidean algorithm.

2.3 Recursive Function
    Exercise 1:
            Write a function that prints the first 50 numbers recursively(no loop)
    Exercise 2:
            Write a recursive function that calculates a factorial given an integer. (i.e. 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120)
    Challenge:

            Calculate the sequence in the Fibonacci numbers. i.e. What is the 7th Fibonacci number? (1,1,2,3,5,8,13) so 13

2.4 Header Files
    Exercise 1:
            Make a header file that contains a vector of integers and include it in the main file of your code. This will be your test data.
    Exercise 2:
            Make another header file that has a function that finds the sum. Include this with exercise 1 from this section and use it on the vector. You should have two separate header files included. 
            Note: Don't forget that if this gets overwhelming with files you can make one header files include all the other header files, then just include that header in your main code.

2.5 Vector in 2D
